why redux toolkit

Redux Toolkit is a set of tools that makes it easier for you, as a web developer, to manage the 
state of your web application. Imagine your web app is like a big container of information, and 
this information can change as users interact with your app. Redux Toolkit helps you keep track 
of this information in a more organized and predictable way.

Now, why would you want to use Redux Toolkit? Well, as your web app grows, it can become 
challenging to manage all the data and make sure different parts of your app are in sync. 
Redux Toolkit provides a clear and structured way to handle this data. It also helps to 
simplify complex tasks like updating information, handling user actions, and ensuring that 
everything works smoothly.

In simpler terms, Redux Toolkit is like a helpful assistant for keeping track of and managing
the important information in your web app, making your job as a developer easier and your 
code more maintainable.
